# Merge sort is similar to a divide and conquer strategy

# SPlIT
# Step 1 We call a split function to split our elements in half
#  Step 2 recursively call this split function until our elements are split into single elemenets


# Merge back
# Now recombine the elements back into the data structure with the larger element going back in first


# the smaller elemeent goes to the left and the larger to the right
# as we recombine we first
# compare the left to the left
# smaller stays on the far left
# the other one is now compared to the other right elemenet and the smaller of those two goes to the second to left
# the other right remainds at the far right as it is the largest of the group
